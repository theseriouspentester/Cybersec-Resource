                        Hello learning enthusiasts! Odds are, if you are reading this that means you are on a
                        computer
                        (bad joke). But lets be real, you might be using a laptop, a desktop or a smartphone which all are one or the other forms of computer. And they have taken over our lives. Everything you see today has
                        something to do with computers and many other stuff involved. And that is actually really cool. Coz they make stuff
                        much
                        easier for us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But as Uncle Ben from spider-Man said with great Power comes Great Responsibility. With so many computers and data
                        and
                        stuff we need to be secure. So the job of Cybersecurity and Information-Security arises. And with the fast changing
                        technologies the number of jobs in this are expected to rise a lot. And well to be honest though there are many
                        cybersecurity enthusiasts like me out there who want to learn and grow and contribute to the field. But when I
                        started I
                        could not find a single place that could direct me to a pathway and roadmap to take. And I am pretty sure many of
                        you
                        face that issue.

                                    I am Chandrasekhar Satapathy, a second year UG student in Chandigarh University. And an aspiring penetration
                                    tester
                                    (fancy word for an ethical hacker) and cybersecurity enthusiast. I offer the solution for this problem.

                                <p>
                                    My friend Yash my classmate (cool guy and an aspiring web-dev) has helped me come up with the idea for this
                                    website
                                    with
                                    the right resources to be the cybersecurity expert.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    My other friends involved in the team are Tanuja and Sanskriti (really hardworking folks). They are the reason
                                    you are looking at this fancy
                                    design
                                    of the website.

                                    Now I want to stress on three things
                                </p>

                                        The most important thing is that it takes years to master even a part of cybersecurity. So have patience and
                                        keep
                                        practicing.
