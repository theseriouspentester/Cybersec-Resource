                            Hello Friends and fellow IT and non IT People, Odds are if you reading this website that
                            means you are on a
                            computer.
                            (Bad Joke). But well Lets be real, you are. May it be laptop a desktop PC a smartphone
                            anything you are using to
                            view
                            this website and read the contents is a computer. And they have taken over our lives.
                            Everything you see today has
                            something to do with computers and many other stuff involved. And that is actually really
                            cool. Coz they make stuff
                            much
                            easier for us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But as Uncle Ben from Spider-Man said with Great Power comes Great Responsibility. With so
                            many computers and data
                            and
                            stuff we need to be secure. So the job of Cybersecurity and Information-Security arises. And
                            with the fast changing
                            technologies the number of Jobs in this are expected to rise a lot. And well to be honest
                            though there are many
                            cybersecurity enthusiasts like me out there who want to learn and grow and contribute to the
                            field. But when I
                            started I
                            could not find a single place that could direct me to a pathway and roadmap to take. And I
                            am pretty sure many of
                            you
                            face that issue.

                        <p>
                            I am Chandrasekhar Satapathy, a second year grad student in Chandigarh University. And an
                            aspiring penetration
                            tester
                            (fancy word for an ethical hacker) and cybersecurity enthusiast. I offer the solution for
                            the problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My friend Yash my classmate (cool guy and an aspiring web-dev) has helped me come up with
                            the idea for this website
                            with
                            the right resources to be the cybersecurity expert.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My other friends involved in the team are Tanuja and Sanskriti (really hardworking folks).
                            They are the reason you are looking at this fancy
                            design
                            of the website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now I want to stress on two three things
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                This website for both techies and non techies.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The most important thing is that it takes years to master even a part of cybersecurity.
                                So have patience and keep
                                practicing.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                And last but not the least Google. It is the most important thing that is going help
                                you. Every time you have an
                                issue
                                Google it. Try to find out why it exists.
