                    <p>As we grow rapidly in the digital era, the threat of cyberattacks have become more prominent. So there are various ways
                    and strategies to tackle such threats. Now the structure of Cybersecurity Team in a company varies on multiple factors
                    such as the size the infrastructure and the service or product of company. Everyone uses various tools techniques and
                    methods and even the team definition changes for each company. But what is important is that the core is common for each
                    company. As we grow up in the IT world our roles change like from being a application security or cloud security
                    engineer or network security to being a CISO or SOC analyst. We learn multiple skills being in the job role with
                    different companies and different teams. Microsoft has a really good article on this. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/08/06/organize-security-team-evolution-cybersecurity-roles-responsibilities/" target="_blank">Click

                    and read about it. But what we are going to focus is on the part where you can get a job as a fresher in IT. So we are
                    going to discuss pentesting and certain aspects acc to pentesting.

                    <legend><h2>Why Penetration Testing ?</h2></legend>
                    <p>
                        Well this question is pretty much the most basic question that we need to answer
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why does a company needs a penetration tester or an ethical hacker?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Speaking in laymen terms, the main reason is that we need to figure out how the attacks can happen or how hackers can
                        attack the company and damage the data or steal them and cause a major economic crisis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Penetration testing is defined by what it is meant to assess. That includes all networks, applications, devices, and
                            physical security components. It mimics the actions of malicious actors. Experienced cybersecurity experts leverage
                            penetration testing to improve a company’s security posture and remove any vulnerabilities that leave it open to attack.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When appropriately done, penetration testing goes beyond merely stopping criminals from unauthorized access to a
                        company’s systems. It creates real-world scenarios that show businesses how well their current defenses would fare when
                        confronted with a full-scale cyber.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Penetration testing verifies the ability of a system to protect its networks, applications, endpoints, and users against
                        both internal or external threats.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, it aims to secure the system controls and shuns any attempt of unauthorized access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now you might be thinking that okay this is a bunch of technical terms or jargons that I’m not used to . What does all
                        this mean? What does endpoint security mean what does application security mean? We’ll get to that later but this part
                        actually tells you why penetration testing is needed in the digital era.
