                                            Cybersecurity or Information Security is the part of IT where we use various tools techniques and programmes and many
                                            sorts of things to secure the cyber-world form potentially bad guys who want to steal your data or hack your website and
                                            do potentially bad stuff with it so that you cannot do the work you want to. From Small scale Industries to Large scale
                                            Corporates and Enterprises. Being digitally safe is of paramount importance. We use many sorts of programmes and
                                            websites digital payment system where our identity is placed our social security number our credit cards our addresses
                                            our entire life story is digitally covered so we definitely don’t want bad people to know about us. Or else we may lose
                                            our money our life our privacy and many things. We are now getting globally connected with various technologies in every

                                These courses are free of cost just sign up and have blast studying them. Once we are done we can dive into more
                                detailed essentials for Cybersecurity.

                                Okay so now that we have a lots of idea about the whole computer world and how things work.

                                And also have little bit of idea about cybersecurity. When I was at this stage I was overwhelmed. So let’s jump into the
                                whole dirt. Now there are 6 things you need to be good at
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Networking</li>
                                    <li>Operating Systems especially Linux( also Windows and Mac-OS but we will get to that later)</li>
                                    <li>Programming</li>
                                    <li>Databases (Relational and Non-Relational)</li>
                                    <li>Cryptographic Techniques</li>
                                    <li>Problem Solving</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now all these that I have listed are just the overview of what we need to begin our carer in cybersecurity. You need a
                                good grasp of all these concepts from basics to intermediate stuff. (I am gonna talk about how soon).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now the odds are you might be thinking how much time do I need to learn all these? I would say roughly about 6 to 8
                                months. The reason I have given is in IT you can never learn everything at once. You will fail badly. So take up max 2
                                things at once and once you master them move on to next and keep in touch with the other two. Once a week at least.

                                    One more myth that I want to bust is you don’t need programming to be good in cybersecurity. That is pure crap because
                                    everything runs on code. How do you protect something if you don’t know how they behave?

                                Imagine driving an automatic car without learning driving. Yeah it will work just fine till you have a problem and you
                                are in of the middle of road, chances are you might get into an accident. But if you know to drive that won’t be an
                                issue.

                                Now let’s look how you can learn Networking and Programming from scratch.

                                Have you guys ever played video games? May be or maybe not. I am sure you guys have social media accounts? Instagram to
                                see your fav celeb’s new post or twitter to see their new tweet. Or when you shoot your friend in COD or PUBG and He
                                dies. How do you think all this is possible? Well the answer is simple Computer Networks.We are living in the 21’st
                                century where everything is globally and digitally connected to each other. Data and the way we transfer data from one
                                place to another is the most important thing today. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a cybersecurity person Computer Networks and Data Communications is something you have to be really strong in. Many
                                Cybersecurity Engineers are even part time or sometimes full time network engineer. So imagine the amount of proficiency
                                they have in that field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So now it depends on you if you wanna get into this field to the top level there are various ways to achieve it but you
                                gonna have to begin somewhere.

                                <li>
                                    The first book you might wanna read is actually is a very small book 
                                    <a href="https://book4you.org/s/How%20the%20Internet%20Really%20Works" target="_blank">How The Internet Really Works</a>. This book will no way teach you the complex stuff going
                                    on but will give you a non-tech idea to what is Internet and Computer Network is about.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Second is a really great book called <a href="https://book4you.org/book/2196530/3bfbaf" target="_blank">Data Communications and Networking</a>.
                                    This is the go to book for every network beginner there coz it pretty much covers everything on the computer networking
                                    for a basic to intermediate level. It will give a crystal clear idea about how everything is done.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Two more book that I think you need to read are  <a href="https://book4you.org/book/2931598/059e2d" target="_blank">The Illustrated Network</a> or
                                    <a href="https://book4you.org/book/2203532/48c6f3" target="_blank">The TCP/IP Guide</a>. The reason I am suggesting them is they will give you a
                                    better Idea about the TCP/IP Architecture.
                                </li>

                                    There are two Certifications at this stage the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network" target="_blank"> CompTIA Network+</a> and the
                                    <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html" target="_blank">Cisco CCNA</a>. Now these
                                    two certifications are really cool and a great addition to IT resume. Like there is a certain respect for the CCNA and
                                    Network+ guys. See if you can and want these certificates go ahead and check them out. But if you don’t want them or
                                    can’t afford them well I am gonna give them for free. The Telegram Channel will be added soon. You can find them there.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    There are many Channels like Neso Academy and NetworkChuck and David Bombal that have free networking courses and
                                    playlists on YouTube do check them out.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>
                                With this I think we get a pretty good idea about networking.
