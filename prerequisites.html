                                Now for people getting into IT I can assure you this is gonna be fun. But hey I am an IT Guy I am supposed to say this.
                                But someone who is entirely new to the world on IT may not agree. So,how can you decide? The simple solution to that is
                                to get a course on IT Fundamentals.

                                            Cybersecurity or Information Security is the part of IT where we use various tools techniques and programmes and many
                                            sorts of things to secure the cyber-world form potentially bad guys who want to steal your data or hack your website and
                                            do potentially bad stuff with it so that you cannot do the work you want to. From small scale industries to large scale
                                            corporates and enterprises. Being digitally safe is of paramount importance. We use many sorts of programmes and
                                            websites digital payment system where our identity is placed our social security number our credit cards our addresses
                                            our entire life story is digitally covered so we definitely don’t want bad people to know about us. Or else we may lose
                                            our money our life our privacy and many things. We are now getting globally connected with various technologies in every

                                    and software and how they function. Stuff like computer devices and parts and network devices and more advance stuff
                                    like cloud and virtualisation techs. These things are going to help you in the long run and they are fun too.

                                    junior IT guy. The main goal of the certification is to know how to troubleshoot basic to intermediate computer bugs and
                                    issues. But it actually teaches a great deal to about many technologies.

                                Okay so now that we have a lots of idea about the whole computer world and how things work.

                                And also have little bit of idea about cybersecurity. When I was at this stage I was overwhelmed. So let’s jump into the
                                whole dirt. Now there are 6 things you need to be good at
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Networking</li>
                                    <li>Operating Systems especially Linux( also Windows and Mac-OS but we will get to that later)</li>
                                    <li>Programming</li>
                                    <li>Databases (Relational and Non-Relational)</li>
                                    <li>Cryptographic Techniques</li>
                                    <li>Problem Solving</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now all these that I have listed are just the overview of what we need to begin our carer in cybersecurity. You need a
                                good grasp of all these concepts from basics to intermediate stuff. (I am gonna talk about how soon).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now the odds are you might be thinking how much time do I need to learn all these? I would say roughly about 6 to 8
                                months. The reason I have given is in IT you can never learn everything at once. You will fail badly. So take up max 2
                                things at once and once you master them move on to next and keep in touch with the other two. Once a week at least.

                                    One more myth that I want to bust is you don’t need programming to be good in cybersecurity. That is pure crap because
                                    everything runs on code. How do you protect something if you don’t know how they behave?

                                Imagine driving an automatic car without learning driving. Yeah it will work just fine till you have a problem and you
                                are in of the middle of road, chances are you might get into an accident. But if you know to drive that won’t be an
                                issue.

                                Now let’s look how you can learn Networking and Programming from scratch.

                                Have you guys ever played video games? May be or maybe not. I am sure you guys have social media accounts? Instagram to
                                see your fav celeb’s new post or twitter to see their new tweet. Or when you shoot your friend in COD or PUBG and he
                                dies. How do you think all this is possible? Well the answer is simple Computer Networks.We are living in the 21’st
                                century where everything is globally and digitally connected to each other. Data and the way we transfer data from one
                                place to another is the most important thing today. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a cybersecurity person Computer Networks and Data Communications is something you have to be really strong in. Many
                                Cybersecurity Engineers are even part time or sometimes full time network engineer. So imagine the amount of proficiency
                                they have in that field.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So now it depends on you if you wanna get into this field to the top level there are various ways to achieve it but you
                                gonna have to begin somewhere.

                                    The first book you might wanna read is actually is a very small book 
                                    <a href="https://book4you.org/s/How%20the%20Internet%20Really%20Works" target="_blank">How The Internet Really Works</a>. This book will no way teach you the complex stuff going
                                    on but will give you a non-tech idea to what is Internet and Computer Network is about.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Second is a really great book called <a href="https://book4you.org/book/2196530/3bfbaf" target="_blank">Data Communications and Networking</a>.
                                    This is the go to book for every network beginner there coz it pretty much covers everything on the computer networking
                                    for a basic to intermediate level. It will give a crystal clear idea about how everything is done.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Two more book that I think you need to read are  <a href="https://book4you.org/book/2931598/059e2d" target="_blank">The Illustrated Network</a> or
                                    <a href="https://book4you.org/book/2203532/48c6f3" target="_blank">The TCP/IP Guide</a>. The reason I am suggesting them is they will give you a
                                    better Idea about the TCP/IP Architecture.
                                </li>

                                    There are two Certifications at this stage the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network" target="_blank"> CompTIA Network+</a> and the
                                    <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html" target="_blank">Cisco CCNA</a>. Now these
                                    two certifications are really cool and a great addition to IT resume. CCNA and Network + are really good for having a good grasp of network engineering. They can help you in long run in
                                    security domain. Like there is a certain respect for the CCNA and
                                    Network+ guys. See if you can and want these certificates go ahead and check them out. But if you don’t want them or
                                    can’t afford them well I am gonna give them for free. The Telegram Channel will be added soon. You can find them there.

                                    There are many Channels like Neso Academy and NetworkChuck and David Bombal that have free networking courses and
                                    playlists on YouTube do check them out.

                                With this I think we get a pretty good idea about networking.

                                Now this section is an interesting one. Coz I can create an entire website on this topic but I am not gonna do that.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Programming is essentially the most important requirement for any IT guy because everything we write runs on code. In
                                some language or the other. These Languages otherwise known as High Level Language run on almost every machine letting
                                us do our work. Websites to servers to OS to kernels to softwares to devices it is a code that is running may it be the
                                functionality or may it be the user interface.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a Cybersec student you have to be confident in logical problem solving.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are several languages involved in several fields for example We use Python or Bash or Perl to script tools. PHP
                                ,JavaScript, .NET are used on the web. Assembly in reverse Engineering and Malware analysis. Java has almost 3 Billion
                                machines in the world now. C++ is used to develop games. SQL is the database query language. So we can easily get
                                overwhelmed as to what we should learn? My answer is learn how to programme because in the end the logic or algorithm is
                                constant. How we use it that comes next.

                                    You can begin this by watching the MIT Courseware free playlist - <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C4720A6F225E074" target="_blank">Introduction to CS and Programming</a>.
                                </li>

                                    Once you are done go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a>. Pick Either python or Javascript tutorial and complete it. Once
                                    you are done. You will have the idea of e various datatypes and variables and stuff used in programming.

                                    Now after this you need to practice. Open <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/" target="_blank">GeeksForGeeks</a> Open the tutorial to follow
                                    it. Then practice the problem set. According to your chosen language.

                                    You can also follow up various tutorials on youtube. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> or  <a href="https://codewithharry.com/#" target="_blank">CodeWithHarry</a>. They also have websites in the
                                    same name you can check them out.

                                <li>
                                    You should also practice data structures and algorithms. These websites also have a section for them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    6) Also practice coding on Hackerrank,LeetCode and CodeChef. Don’t stop learning and practicing. Atleast code two hours
                                    a day.

                                These things can barely scratch the surface of what programming is.What I have mentioned above is my personal path and also there are many other things I have used many books,
                                websites,blogs and writeups etc. There are tons and tons of other resources and each one is equally good. But the main
                                motive is to practice. If you have your own way figured out go with that. Now you can learn on your own.

                                Once so now we have learned about Networking and we are practicing coding and logic formation. We need to learn a major
                                topic Operating Systems and System Administration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now the two major OS used in Cybersecurity are Linux and Windows. We know Windows has a lot of market share in PC and
                                Workstation but when it comes to servers Linux trumps it. But there are many enterprises that still use Windows Server
                                and as we will see in Active Directory (don’t panic).

                                Now learning about operating systems is easy. You can find numerous youtube channels and websites on this like MIT Courseware
                                Operating System or Neso Academy. Or you can try to read books on it like  <a href="https://1lib.in/book/3509014/456f35" target="_blank">Operating System Concepts</a>.

                                This has like tons of resources online. Websites Courses Tutorials certifications or many more stuff. But I am gonna
                                provide you a way to learn about it in a streamlined way from basics

                                    Cisco Netcad Academy is a really good place to start. They have two free courses to learn Linux Basic and
                                    Intermediate. <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/os-it/ndg-linux-unhatched" target="_blank">GNU Linux Basics</a> and  <a href="https://www.netacad.com/courses/os-it/ndg-linux-essentials" target="_blank">GNU Linux Intermediate</a>

                            <p>
                                There are many topics that you will come across during pentesting like Linux Security ,Bash Shell Scripting Web Server
                                Administration and stuff and also red hat linux administration. There is essentially a job for sys-admin that well many
                                penetration testers look after. I can’t explain all this here but you can search for topics online and practice and
                                learn.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now you can practice your linux skills on  <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/" target="_blank">Over The Wire</a> (Bandit).

                                . My advice is do it yourself ,consult the
                                walkthrough if you are stuck. Also these Websites are a great place to learn many other stuff we will get to later.

                                This is an important aspect that we need to focus on. It is database administration and SQL and also No-SQL. As Tech
                                improves day by data number of data is also increases. So big enterprises need something called Database Administration
                                System. There is a whole big field of tech out there related to tech.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since data is the most important aspect of today’s world. Everyone wants to protect their data. If as a pen tester you
                                cannot help them save their data you are worthless. So we need to learn the database administration. Both relational and
                                non-relational.

                                    Since there are various DBMS software out there like Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MySQL, MongoDB and many more. You can use
                                    either of them but there might be slight differences in some parts of it.

                                One more important part is Cryptography but we will learn it during network security.

                                Now you must be thinking Dude you made us learn so many things when are we actually going to learn how to hack? I know
                                the feeling the overwhelming excitement of learning so many things. But in reality we have covered around 30 percent of
                                pen testing already. The more you know the stuff you want to hack the better you can hack it. So my advice is to just do
                                one thing at a time. Never multitask because that will be disastrous and time wasting. These things are going to take
                                time. For 6 to 8 months but they will put you at least 2 years ahead of someone who is not. Because believe me you will
                                need these concepts.
